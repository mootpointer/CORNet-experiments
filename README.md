# [CORnet-experiments](https://github.com/mootpointer/CORnet-experiments)

Based on the [CORnet Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/408385v1)

## Goal 1: Re-implement CORnet
 - Use PyTorch with some FastAI
 - Demonstrate core NN concepts as we go
 - Show similar results against ImageNet

## Goal 2: Compare to what we know about ventral visual stream
 - Look for similarities in V1 (angled gratings etc)
 - Find evidence for "Grandmother Cells"

## Goal 3: Experiment with visual phenomena
 - Here be dragons
