# CORnet-experiments

## Goal 1: Re-implement CORnet
 - Use PyTorch with some FastAI
 - Demonstrate core NN concepts as we go
 - Show similar results against ImageNet

## Goal 2: Compare to what we know about ventral visual stream
 - Look for similarities in V1 (angled gratings etc)
 - Find evidence for "Gradmother Cells"

## Goal 3: Experiment with visual phenomena
 - Here be dragons
